Hi, guys))
Share the light version of our app.
Features:
1)Personalizing by language and hashtags
2)No retweets, only new information

The app(stores in 1 file netw_last) creates file(in the directory with app) for every user with interesting tweets for him( based on his tastes:)

Code not commented wery well, but it is based on the shared file so it is more or less clear.(Ill comment it better soon)

PLEASE TRY TO TEST AN APP IN DIFFERENT WAYS(with different lang, hashtags...)
It would be good if you can provide new ideas for personalization(based on twitter API not just random idias:)

Recommendations for testing:
Use python 2.7
Use IDLE as a python development tool
Might be some prblems with importing oauth library( in this case just download it manually with dependencies and put into Lib dirictory)

Thank you for your time,
Good luck in your exams.
